# FriendFinder

**FriendFinder utilizes Node and Express Servers**

**FriendFinder is similar to a fun quiz you may see on Buzzfeed. This quiz matches you with a cartoon character friend based on your compatability.**

**Complete the 10 question quiz and the app will display a cartoon character friend that best matches your personality and interests.**

*In this app, I have created a Friend API that is utilized in this app.*

*The app is hosted on heroku so you can see the full working app here: TBD*

*To run this program using the code provided in Github, you will need to install the required npm packages (express and body-parser)*
